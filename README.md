# Hangman Game

## Project Description

The Hangman Game is a word game in which players try to guess a hidden word letter by letter before running out of lives.
In this project, I have implemented a Python version of the game where random English words are generated, and players have a limited number of lives to guess the word. 
Each incorrect letter reduces the available lives, and if they run out of lives, the game is over.

### Key Features

- Random generation of English words to guess.
- Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.
- Life counter that decreases with each incorrect letter.
- Opportunity to win by guessing the word before running out of lives.
